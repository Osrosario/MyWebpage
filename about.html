            <div class="box">
                <p>
                    I'm a Marine Corps Veteran with a passion for video games. I'm currently studying computer with a 
                    minor in game design and development at Quinnipiac University. At Quinnipiac, I've learned various 
                    programming langauges (Scala, Java, JavaScript, C#, and Python), object-oriented programming model,
                    computer architecture, operating systems, data structures, algorithm design, and project management. 
                    Video game development is how I apply what I learned in my computer sciences classes which helps 
                    me make robust and mechanically sound video games.

                <h2>Why I Chose Computer Science</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The sense of accomplishment from figuring out a problem. In the Marine Corps, I was an artillery
                        mechanic. Half of my job revolved around maintaining the weapon and the other half entailed figuring out 
                        what was wrong with it if something wasn't working. I enjoyed the process of diagnosing the issue, fixing
                        it, and making it work again. I get the same enjoyment from programming. I'm given a problem, and it's my
                        job to find an efficient solution and implement it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I'm able to make video games instead of just playing them. Although I acknowledge that other parts of video 
                        game development are important, such as art and music, I believe that making a game that's mechanically sound
                        is the most important aspect. Nothing matters if the game doesn't work.
                    </li>

                        I've heard this saying somewhere: "Major in what will get you money, minor in what you love."
