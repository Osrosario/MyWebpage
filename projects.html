                <p>
                    Fallout Adventure is a text-based adventure game based off Bethesda's Fallout series where 
                    the player exits his/her vault to explore the radiation-filled landscape. The story is written 
                    using the "Strings of Pearl" story-telling method that has branching paths but concludes to a 
                    single ending. This game features a round-based battle system where the player and the opposing 
                    NPC (non-playable character) will take turns choosing actions. This game also includes an inventory 
                    system where the player can view their respective character stats, obtain, use, manage, and discard items.

                <p>
                    Bolerite is a 3D platformer, puzzle game. To keep a low profile, you have entered through the vents of 
                    a facility holding a valuable, and rare material. As a safe safety precaution, the owners of this 
                    facility lock the three different keys that open the room to this material. Sneak your way through 
                    the ventilation, jump and solve your way through locks, and retrieve the Bolerite.
